# Generics

## What exactly generics are?

One of the most powerful caracter√≠stics of the Swift language.
Generic programming is a way to write functions and data types while making minimal assumptions about the type of data being used.
It allows you to write a function once and use it on different types.
Allowing for elegant abstractions that produce cleaner code with fewer bugs. 

A hight average of the standard swift libraries are write with generic code (Array, Dictionary, Optional...)

the Optional data type is generic over the type of value it might contain.
